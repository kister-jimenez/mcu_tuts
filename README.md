# Microcontroller Self-Study Guide

This is a self-study guide for microcontroller firmware development. Each topic contains examples and exercises that will guide you in learning the basics of MCU firmware development.

## Folder structure
```
Root folder
+-- images
|   Contains images linked by the different tutorials in the folders
|
+-- tutorials
|   +-- c_overview
|   |   contains the different C topics segregated by folders.
|   |
|   +-- mcu_tutorial
|   |   contains the different C topics segregated by folders.

--- README.md
```

Each tutorial has a main README file discussing the overview of the topics. This may include instructions on how to install the tools as well as some basic information about the tools. Each topic is segragated by folder with the folder name N_topic. These folders also contain README files to discuss about the examples and exercises. If the exercises require source codes, you can find it inside the topic folder. The source code may also contain comments that discusses some fundamentals.  

Some topics may have several exercises. There may be topic folders with multiple sub folders for different exercise codes. You may also be required to write some codes and projects. As much as possible, if you will be required to write codes, create these files and project folders relative to the the topic folder unless instructed with a specific directory.
